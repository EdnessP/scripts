    Bugfix release!
    Fixed issues:
     * Made stuff written to be more compact.
     * Added a length check for DAT and BIN files, due false errors being caused from seeking on heeader files with DGIorio's Burnout Paradise scripts.
     * Partial fix for (unused) small DXT3 and DXT5 Xbox 360 textures. (Disabled by default, set boDebug to 2 to enable it)
     * Added GtID decompression support, although currently no real use for it, other than printing GtIDs from LoadScrn.bin.
     * Added proper Need for Speed: Shift PSP texture support due to being almost fully identical to Burnout.

     * 2px width 4-bit PS2 textures.
     * 2px width and height DXT Xbox textures.
     * 4px width 4-bit and 8-bit PS2 textures.
        * These should cover all the small textures that cause issues.  More may eventually crop up.
     * Early Revenge Frontend BINs were partially broken due to the texture index not always starting with 1.
        * The ARENA exporter can likely be improved with this fix as well, but it already is "good enough."
    Known issues:
     * Unused Xbox 360 textures under 16px width are broken by being padded to 128px and after 32px in height offset by 8px.
     * Similarly, unused Xbox 360 8px height textures only start after 72px.
        * These do not affect other textures that are used.  Likely not going to be fixed.
